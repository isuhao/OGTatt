**OG Tatt** is a top-down urban shoot-em-up set in a world where respect is only the beginning. 
Players can play without joining an existing gang. Play on your own and create a gang with at least three people whenever you feel like it. You'll have to earn enough respect to get an HQ and to be mentioned.
